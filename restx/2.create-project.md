# Congratulations! - Your app is now ready in /private/var/www/restx-start

# Your app has 2 modules: ui and srv
# In srv, you can:
#   - open the module in your IDE by importing the Maven pom, and run the
#        `restx.start.AppServer` class to launch
#   - run it from restx shell, using:
#       deps install
#               to install its dependencies
#       app run
#               to run it

# In ui you can:
#   - open and edit your front end source files with your favorite editor
#   - copy files to `dist` directory to make them available to RESTX web server
#     hint: you can use the build.sh for that

# At root level you can:
#   - build a production ready war using Maven (Linux/MacOS only):
#       mvn package
# Enjoy!
