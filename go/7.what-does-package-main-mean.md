## Types of packages

1. Executable   Generates a file that we can run  
2. Reusable     Code used as 'helpers'. Good place to put resuable logic

package main

go build  
->  
main.exe    if we ran this file, the function named 'main' would be automatically ran  

## Flow (Exp.2)

package blahblah  
->  
go build  
->  
nothing!    Compilling a non-main package gives
